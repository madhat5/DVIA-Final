### Project Approach
Answer project questions as you go along
1. Audience questions + sketch
2. Check + prep data (acquire, parse, filter)
3. Mine/explore/sketch/iterate several simple graphics, re: stories (same or diff?), pick one
4. Code initial draft (pseudo first?)
5. Refine/declutter/clean/annotate/clarify (color, labels, titles, legend, summary, etc)
6. Interactivity (more than tooltips, eg: scrolling)
7. Share

- What does the visualization enable?
- Is this a static visualization? Is it interactive?
- color: Is it intentional and intuitive? data decodable by audience?

    - legends, annotations
- clear text hierarchy?
- link to raw data?

### Concept & build
1. `Types of data`
- dataset: 
    > https://www.pro-football-reference.com/
    > https://www.betfirm.com/point-spreads-for-every-super-bowl/
    > https://www.thelines.com/super-bowl-coin-toss-history/
    > https://sercc.com/SuperBowlClimate.pdf
    - starting at 2000
- mostly quantitative, and temporal including:
    - quant (toggle btw?):
        - layout for scatter plot?
            - color for favorite/underdog; 
            - shape for winner/loser
            - x = years; y = odds/coin toss?
        - betting odds
        - record (wins/losses, margins of victory?, heads up record)?
        - coin toss record
            - heads/tails?
        - injuries
        - weather (temp. wind, precipitation)?
    - geo: 
        - locations of both teams + SB location?
        - radius = times team has won (historical)
        - color = favorite/underdog
- sketch: report includes
    - scatter plot?
    - map
- interactive
    - can i build in such a way where user toggles variables to see outcomes?
    - add guessing game?
        - hide winner/loser stats > have user guess > reveal w/l

2. `Questions`
- does spread measure the rate of uncertainty? (eg higher spread = higher uncertainty)

3. `Audience`
- Target:
    - sports enthusiats/analysts
    - sports team managers?
- What factors influence championship wining seasons?
- have an interactive report, with a drop down for years (+ all)?

4. `Tools`
    - d3 (circle packing)
    - JS/CSS/HTML (custom)
    - Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator


### next
- position + radius based on spread & over/under
- size
- bg:
    - color circles per team
    - or setup custom diagram


### quick notes
- Data
    - > (sports-reference?)
    - 1. how sports odds/betting measures even uncertainty? (odds vs result)
        - factors that go in to odds include: 
            - win/loss rates; winning streaks
            - individual player acquisitions
            - previous record agains team x
    - 2. championship coin toss vs game winner?
        - probability of winning game with coin toss?
    - *3. a complete evaluation report of championship uncertainty in sports?*
        - frequency framing of coin toss
        - distribution chart of win/loss
        - error bar of points scored?
        - chart for odds from (1.)

- likely visuals
    - error bars, confidence bands (more technical user friendly)
    - frequency framing (more lay user friendly)
        - visualizing a probability as a frequency
    - quantile dot plot?
    - multi chart?
        - pick team > odds team winning > odds division winning > odds conference winning
