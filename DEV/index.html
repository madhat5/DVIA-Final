                <b>About</b>
                <br><br>
                As I understand uncertainty, I think both the spread and over/under are ways to measure that in sports:
                <ul>
                    <li>The <b>spread</b> represents both the favored team, and how much it is thought they’ll win by.
                    </li>
                    <li>The <b>over/under</b> represents a guess of the total score.</li>
                </ul>
                My goal for this visualization is to visually represent the accuracy with which sports betting measures
                uncertainty, compared to the results of the game. I'm using football because it is currently football
                season, and the superbowl because it provides a small but important data set. This should be replicable
                over regular season and playoff games, as well as other sports.

                <b>Conclusions:</b>
                <br><br>
                This exercise revealed a few interesting things for me.
                <ul>
                    <li>The sweet spots for accuracy (aka least uncertainty) are
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>color ratio</b>, representing the score margin between both teams: between 4.0 and 6.7</li>
                            <li><b>radius ratio</b>, representing the total score of the game: between 13.8 and 22.5</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The majority of superbowls were determined to be close games, which makes sense considering this
                        is a game between the supposed best of each conference.</li>
                    <li>For those games with a higher spread (> -9), the over/under measurment is less accurate.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                <b>Chart:</b>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each circle represents a Superbowl.</li>
                    <li><b>Circle radius:</b> is the total score estimate (over/under) divided by the actual total
                        score. The
                        radius size will be used as a measure of score uncertainty, where the larger the radius the
                        greater the difference under the actual score, and the smaller the radius the greater the
                        difference over the actual score.</li>
                    <li><b>Color:</b> is used to represent the estimated spread divided by the actual spread. The
                        lighter color represents a high difference, with spread estimate > actual spread. The darker
                        color represents a high difference, with spread estimate < actual spread. </li> <li><b>x
                                axis:</b> the value along the x axis represents the spread value for the game.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <b>Definitions:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Uncertainty:</strong> "something that is uncertain or that causes one to feel
                        uncertain." (Oxford Dictionaries)</li>
                    <li><strong>Point Spread:</strong> The spread, also referred to as the line, is used to even the
                        odds between two unevenly matched teams. Bookmakers set a spread with the hopes of getting equal
                        action on both sides of a game.</li>
                    <li><strong>Over/Under:</strong>An over–under or over/under (O/U) bet is a wager in which a
                        sportsbook will predict a number for a statistic in a given game (usually the combined score of
                        the two teams), and bettors wager that the actual number in the game will be either higher or
                        lower than that number.</li>
                    <li><strong>project math</strong>(radius, position)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <i><b>Notes:</b> 2 superbowls were removed</i>
                <ul>
                    <li>pick em': Seahawks vs Patriots. A “pick em” is when the teams have a point spread of zero, hence
                        neither team is favored.
                    </li>
                    <li>SB1 did not have gambiling information.</li>
