                <b>About</b>
                <br><br>
                As I understand uncertainty, I think both the spread and over/under are ways to measure that in sports:
                <ul>
                    <li>The <b>spread</b> represents both the favored team, and how much it is thought they’ll win by.
                    </li>
                    <li>The <b>over/under</b> represents a guess of the total score.</li>
                </ul>
                My goal for this visualization is to visually represent the accuracy with which sports betting measures
                uncertainty, compared to the results of the game. I'm using football because it is currently football
                season, and the superbowl because it provides a small but important data set. This should be replicable
                over regular season and playoff games, as well as other sports.

                <b>Conclusions:</b>
                <br><br>
                This exercise revealed a few interesting things for me.
                <ul>
                    <li>The majority of superbowls were determined to be close games, which makes sense considering this is a game between the supposed best of each conference.</li>
                    <li>For those games with a higher spread (> -9), the over/under measurment is less accurate.</li>
                    <!-- <li>The two games with the highest spread were </li> -->
                </ul>
            </p>

                <b>Chart:</b>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each circle represents a Superbowl.</li>
                    <li><b>Circle radius:</b> is the over/under betting number divided by the actual total score. The radius size will be used as a measure of score uncertainty, where the larger the radius the greater the under, and the smaller the radius the greater the over.</li>
                    <li><b>Color:</b> is used to represent  the value difference in estimated spread vs actual spread. The lighter color represents a high difference, with spread estimate > actual spread. The darker color represents a high difference, with spread estimate < actual spread.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>x axis:</b> the value along the x axis represents the spread value for the game.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <b>Definitions:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Uncertainty:</strong> "something that is uncertain or that causes one to feel uncertain." (Oxford Dictionaries)</li>
                    <li><strong>Point Spread:</strong> The spread, also referred to as the line, is used to even the odds between two unevenly matched teams. Bookmakers set a spread with the hopes of getting equal action on both sides of a game.</li>
                    <li><strong>Over/Under:</strong>An over–under or over/under (O/U) bet is a wager in which a sportsbook will predict a number for a statistic in a given game (usually the combined score of the two teams), and bettors wager that the actual number in the game will be either higher or lower than that number.</li>
                    <li><strong>project math</strong>(radius, position)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <i><b>Notes:</b> 2 superbowls were removed</i>
                <ul>
                    <li>pick em': Seahawks vs Patriots. A “pick em” is when the teams have a point spread of zero, hence neither team is favored.
                    </li>
                    <li>SB1 did not have gambiling information.</li>
