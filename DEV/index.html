            <h2>Summary and conclusion</h2>
            <p>each circle represents a superbowl
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>the radius is the over/under betting number divided by the actual total score (I’m hoping to
                        represent
                        the radius size as a measure of score uncertainty, so the larger the radius the greater the
                        difference
                        between the guess and the actual final score)</li>
                    <li>the value along the x axis represents the spread for the game (i’m hoping to use a color scheme
                        to
                        represent whether the favored team won/lost vs underdogs won/lost)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                As i understand uncertainty, I think both the spread and over/under are ways to measure that in sports
                <ul>
                    <li>the over/under represents a guess of the total score</li>
                    <li>the spread represents both the favored team and how much it is thought they’ll win by</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                notes: 2 superbowls were removed
                <ul>
                    <li>pick em': Seahawks vs Patrios (explain)</li>
                    <li>SB1</li>
