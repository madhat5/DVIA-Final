    <h1>The uncertainty of the Superbowl</h1>
    <div id="content">
        <svg width="1400" height="200">

    <h2>Summary and conclusion</h2>
    <p>each circle represents a superbowl
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>the radius is the over/under betting number divided by the actual total score (I’m hoping to represent
                the radius size as a measure of score uncertainty, so the larger the radius the greater the difference
                between the guess and the actual final score)</li>
            <li>the value along the x axis represents the spread for the game (i’m hoping to use a color scheme to
                represent whether the favored team won/lost vs underdogs won/lost)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        As i understand uncertainty, I think both the spread and over/under are ways to measure that in sports
        <ul>
            <li>the over/under represents a guess of the total score</li>
            <li>the spread represents both the favored team and how much it is thought they’ll win by</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        notes: 2 superbowls were removed

            <li>pick em': Seahawks vs Patrios (explain)</li>
            <li>SB1</li>
